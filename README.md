This short project is dedicated to estimating Diameter at height (DBH), height, and volume in a forest stand in the Whitehall Forest, Georgia. The work was implemented in R 3.6.1 and RStudio 1.2.5033. Another important motivation for this paper is to demonstrate how R manage and compute point cloud data by embedding the complete R code used for this project. Readers of this paper can get the same result as I got by just following the code presented.
